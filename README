I'm somewhat seriously house hunting, and find it difficult to compare
listings on a few characteristics that mapper to me on the real estate
websites. I also wanted to try my hand at a browser-based application.
This is the result; an unpolished and not particularly attractive mashup
of Google maps (okay, so aggregating data from one set of APIs isn't
really a mashup) that lets me plot waypoints for houses and destinations
that I can about (grocery stores, work, culture, etc) and compare travel
times between those points. I intend to add other sources of data, too;
in particular, I'd like to associate each house with a walk score, and
possibly other things.
